# DSA Workspace

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations, competitive programming templates, and useful coding tricks. The workspace is organized by platform and topic for easy navigation and learning.

## Directory Structure

- **codeChef/**  
  Solutions and templates for CodeChef problems.
  - `Codechef.java`: Competitive programming template and sample solution.
  - `ForOneTasteCase.java`: Placeholder for single test case solutions.

- **codeForces/**  
  Solutions and templates for Codeforces problems.
  - `codeforcesTemplate.java`: General template with utility functions for contests.

- **go_language/**  
  Go language experiments and code.
  - `main.go`: Main Go file.
  - `go.mod`: Go module definition.

- **Imp-DS-code/**  
  Important Data Structures code implementations.
  - `DisjointSet.java`: Disjoint Set (Union-Find) implementation.
  - `LRUCache.java`: LRU Cache using a doubly linked list and hashmap.
  - `Mergesort.java`: Merge Sort algorithm.
  - `Quicksort.java`: Quick Sort algorithm.
  - `segmentTree.java`: Segment Tree for range maximum queries.

- **leetcode/**  
  Placeholder for LeetCode solutions (currently empty).

- **segTreesCode/**  
  Segment Tree implementations for different operations.
  - `segTreeForMax.java`: Segment Tree for range maximum queries.
  - `segTreeForSum.java`: Segment Tree for range sum queries.

- **.idea/**, **.vscode/**  
  IDE and editor configuration files.

- **ImportantTriks.txt**  
  Handy tricks and observations for problem-solving.

- **timeComplexity.png**  
  Image reference for time complexity of algorithms.

## How to Use

- Java files can be compiled and run individually using `javac` and `java`.
- Go code can be run using `go run main.go` inside the `go_language` directory.
- Refer to `ImportantTriks.txt` for quick problem-solving strategies.

## Highlights

- Efficient implementations of classic algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
- Advanced data structures (LRU Cache, Disjoint Set, Segment Trees).
- Ready-to-use templates for competitive programming platforms.
- Performance benchmarking for LRU Cache operations.
